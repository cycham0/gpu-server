# Help in using university server

## About this article
I want to write something about how to use the university serversssss, and the difficulties I face.
It is the first time I use school linux server + gpu server + slurm + additional disk space applied for project. So it maybe not accurate at all, but at least it work in my case, LOL.

## Talk about what I am using
First at all, every student has a account + password to login department linux server
Let it be
> account name: id
> password: pw

And linux server has many, in my case there are around 20-30 servers in a department. You need to connect the VPN first, then ssh linux<number>.<hostname>
There is another way, without connect VPN, that is ssh first then choose server.
I have tried both ways, seems connect VPN first is a more stable in connecting linux server.

TBC. :D
